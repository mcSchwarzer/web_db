[Verse 1]
It's late at night, I go to bed
But I can't get no rest
My boyfriend quit, I'm almost dead
I'll have to do my best
I'm up and down, I feel so fat
I ain't got no more fizz
Don't even get to keep the cat
But that's just how it is

[Chorus]
I sing:
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da-da
Everybody sing:
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
I get up late, I stub my toe
I've got a few missed calls
I lost my job, I didn't know
And that's not good at all
I get my bag, I go outside
Just mindin' my own biz
I go to pay, but my card's been denied
Well, that's just how it is

[Chorus]
I sing:
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da-da
Everybody sing:
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 3]
Another week, the same old shit
My troubles gettin' worse
And then I get a bigger hit
'Cause someone stole my purse
I met a guy, he knows my name
He also told me his
And if we want to have some fun
Well, that's just how it is

[Chorus]
I sing:
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da-da
Everybody sing:
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Wap-bap, ba-da-da-da-da-da
